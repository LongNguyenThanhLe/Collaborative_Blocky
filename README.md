# 🧩 Collaborative Blockly

## 🚀 Vision

We're enhancing Google's Blockly programming environment to create virtual spaces where autistic youth can learn to code and collaborate through **scaffolded, supportive interactions**. Our mission is to make programming collaboration accessible, enjoyable, and growth-oriented for all learning styles.

## 🌟 Project Goals

- 🤝 Develop collaboration skills in **manageable stages**
- 🛡️ Allow coding in shared projects with **carefully scaffolded separation** of effort
- 🔄 Ease the coordination skills required for simultaneous code editing 
- 🌉 Create bridges between independent work and shared projects
- 💪 Build confidence through structured collaborative experiences

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Many autistic youth have natural talents for logical thinking and technology but may find traditional collaborative environments challenging. Our platform provides:

- 🔍 Clear visual boundaries and ownership of code sections
- 🕰️ Self-paced integration into collaborative workflows
- 📊 Reduced cognitive load during social interactions
- 🎯 Focused learning experiences that build on individual strengths

## 💻 Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the web application
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe code development
- **Blockly**: Google's library for visual block-based programming
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Custom protocols for scaffolded interaction

## 🚦 Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
